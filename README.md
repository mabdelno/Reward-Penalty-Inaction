# Reward-Penalty-Inaction
This program is meant to compare the reinforcement learning algorithms of reward-penalty vs. reward-inaction with the multi-arm bandit problem.
Reward-penalty increases the probability of an action being taken if a reward is achieved and decreases the probability of an action being taken if a reward is not achieved.
Reward-inaction increases the probability of an action being taken if a reward is achieved, but does not affect the probability of an action being taken if a reward is not achieved.
